# VRChat-Openbullet2-Config
A config demonstrating the lack of any security on vrchat's login endpoint. 

I've kept this private to myself for a while, but seeing as vrchat still does not yet understand how to implement basic security standards I feel they need a push to do better

I am not responsible for what you do with this config, it is soley to demonstrate a security fault, and for educational purpose.
